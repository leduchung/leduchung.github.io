I take note the points in the book "Beginning Application Lifecycle Management" by Joachim Rossberg. Just a note for me.

# Chapter 1 - Why application Lifecycle Management Matters

 - The organization must be responding to the changes in the modern world
 - Business is not only the commercial part of the company but all the functions
 - Three cornerstones of business: process, business rules, and information
 - Business software is for turning business needs and opportunities into business value
 - Problems we face in today's business environment
    - Global environment: both opportunities and challenges
    - Business must become more agile
    - Communication becomes increasingly complex
 - Project health today - 3 criteria to success (but we need to be skeptical due to the rapid change):
    - Project delivered on time
    - Project delivered on budget
    - Project goals met
 - Factor influencing projects and their success
    - The gap between business and IT (security/availability/scalability v.s business processes)
    - The development process: must be simple and transparent under the tools, so developers can focus on the work but still follow the processes. Nowadays, processes must be flexible too
    - Geographic spread
    - Synchronization of tools
    - Resource management
    - Project size
 - Project success: Research says about ten reasons:
    1. User involvement
    2. Executive management support
    3. Clear business objectives
    4. Optimizing scope
    5. Agile process
    6. Project manager expertise
    7. Financial management
    8. Skilled resources
    9. Formal methodology
    10. Standard tools and infrastructure
