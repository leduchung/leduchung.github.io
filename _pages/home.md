# My tech

### DevOps and IT Operations (from 12/2016 until now)
 
 > At [TTTech Computertechnik AG](https://www.tttech.com/), I have my days full of automation, integration, testing and supports. I am improving the development processes of thousands developers.

### Cloud, network and IoT (3/2013 to 10/2016)
 
> At [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/), I read papers, prototyped research ideas and consumed coffee. That was an amazing but the most challenging time in my life (so far).

### Cluster, GPU, Grid (before 2013)

> At [HUST](https://en.hust.edu.vn/), I learned the systems and rolled into the research. Time back then was fun with full energy of young.

# My philosophy 

* Software is complex!
> * No, software should be simple and nice. Human is complex.
* You can do anything, keep walking!
> * No, you cannot do everything. Life is full of choices and you should only go for what important to you.  
> * The same when crafting software.
* First you do the right thing, then you do the thing right.
> * Ok-ish, but I do not (fully) believe in the right thing. I take decisions and make them right.  
> * The same for software craftmanship.
